    Peer based learning is a pedagogical practice 
    that improves ownership and investment in learning among 
    students. When students teach and learn from their peers, 
    they develop better clarity about the content 
    being taught, while the student teachers develop future ready skills 
    like collaboration, problem solving and become stronger 
    communicators. It also create a culture of students learning 
    from each other and taking ownership of their learning hence reducing dependency on teachers.

      With schools being shut during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      the learning of many of our students came to a complete halt. In order to prevent loss of learning, 
      We decided to move our Peer Teaching program online. We started a WhatsApp based Learn from Home program to engage students through activities and projects.
      The Online Peer Teaching program was also launched where selected Student-Leaders would teach their peers using Google Meet/ Zoom/ WhatsApp calls or regular calls. 
      The core purpose of this program, besides the continuous learning, was to ensure social and emotional well- being of the students while supporting them in their learning during the pandemic, 
      By 2022, we aspire to impact 1000 students through this program creating more future ready student-leaders and academically improves learners.
