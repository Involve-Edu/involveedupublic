       और मेरे लर्नर्स मेरे से सवाल पूछते हैं तो मुझे बहुत  अच्छा लगता है और मैं भी अब अपने टीचर से 
       अपना डाउट पूछता हूँ ”. Cheeranlal, very proudly also said  “ जब ये लर्नर लोग मेरा
       बात मानते हैं, भैया बोलते हैं तो बहुत अच्छा लगता है”

      What if we tell you that if dedication to follow your goal has passion has no age?
      This story is about a girl named Amrita from Jheelpipadiya who studies in the IInd 
      Standard.
      One day I got late in the evening at the Kutir. That's why my eyes fell on Amrita. She was going home with a torch in her hand. I stopped her and asked, "Do you come to the Kutir every day?". I was stunned to hear her answer, "Yes, sir, both school and Kutir." 
      I then asked her, "You carry this torch from morning in the school to evening in the Kutir; what if someone steals it?" She replied, "No sir, they are all my friends. They would never steal it."
      I finally asked her, "Do you like studying?" To which she immediately replied, 'Yes, sir, I do. That's why I come every day."
      
      After this response, I immediately started thinking of the rest of the students as these days it becomes dark early, and most of the students don't come to the Kutir in the evening. And here Amrita was carrying a torch from morning to evening just because she liked studying.
