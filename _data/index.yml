student_crisis:
  title: THE STUDENT CRISIS IN INDIA.
  blurb: >
    The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the frailties of our education system. 
    The loss of spaces and structures of education led to tremendous loss of learning,as it is 
    established by the APU report on “Learning Loss during the pandemic”.
    This loss can be, on the one hand, attributed to the resource inequality and the challenges of online zlearning, but on the other hand, to the lack of ownership in our students.  

challenge_to_solve:
  title: HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS?
  blurb: >
    Our Theory of Change is that children learn better in group environments, 
    amongst their peers via discussion, reflection & inquiry. This builds self-awareness, 
    confidence & thinking process in them that improves learning outcomes, skills & ownership. 

    We, as an organization have 3 core principles, co-creation and design with students, led by students, 
    and active participation through choice of students.

    In order to follow these 3 principles, we follow the ‘Peer Teaching Model’ which reworks the
    lines of responsibility within and around classrooms.

      "I was in a position to tell students what to do and what not to do, so I think that made me responsible. Also, you can't go unplanned when you teach students, so I used to plan before every class. I also had to go for my tuition and make class plans for teaching my learners, which also led to the skill of prioritizing."
