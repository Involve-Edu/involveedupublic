student_crisis:
  title: THE STUDENT CRISIS IN INDIA.
  blurb: >
    These challenges exist because students' learning is entirely dependent
    on teachers, and they have always been passive participants in the
    learning process. This is unsustainable because the world is changing and
    we don't have the teaching infrastructure to support the personalized attention needed.

challenge_to_solve:
  title: HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS?
  blurb: >
    We believe that developing student agency and making students more self-reliant,
    will reduce their dependence on the teachers in the learning process. For this to
    happen, students will need to take ownership of their learning and develop the
    necessary skill sets for them to thrive. Towards this vision, Involve takes a
    two-pronged approach. On one side, through our peer based programs, we equip students
    with academic and future ready skills. While on the other side, we work with the larger
    education landscape to build an ecosystem of trust for our student, empowering them to
    take stronger ownership of their lives.

    In the next 5 years, we want to develop student agency in 1 million students
    via various programs of peer based learning with presence in minimum 3 states.
    We also will work towards policy recommendation to have time allocated for
    Peer based learning (via curriculum design - Strategies for Peer to peer learning, Bridge
    program through Peer Teaching)

      Earlier I would get angry at my friends if they did something that I did not like. After joining the Peer Teaching program, I learnt how to behave like a true student leader. I learnt how to listen when someone speaks, especially my teachers. Also, in the process of teaching maths to my learners I have also improved myself. I believe I have become a better person now.

      The teachers usually use the board to teach, but here in our peer teaching class I learn from my friends who teach using different teaching methods. We play and learn together. In 7th standard I want to become a student-leader. I am excited about that because I will also get to teach other students.

      My child joined the Peer teaching program and I've seen many changes in her since then. Once I saw that she was not able to study one subject, so I was worried and spoke to her Involve fellow. She immediately spoke to my daughter and guided her. She also helped my daughter make a timetable which she uses regularly to track her day! Earlier she was a featherless bird, now she has the feathers of Involve.

      Peer Teaching is a unique concept enabling students to share their learning experience, helping fellow students. Student-leaders encourage peers to clear their doubts and learning becomes fun. I have seen their work in some of the corporation schools in Mylapore. I was amazed at the transformation among the student-leaders and learners.
