  blurb: >
    Our Peer-Teaching program is a 3 year academic and leadership 
    building program. We partners with schools where students from Grade 7 
    and above volunteer to be Student Leaders (SLs) who then teach and 
    mentor learners from lower grades and aim to bridge their academic gaps. 
    In the process SLs develop 21st century skills. Our 4+ hours of intervention 
    per week using well-researched pedagogies and age appropriate leadership 
    sessions ensure a hoistic development of students.

  blurb: >
    The first two years of our program require strong operations support. For this purpose we initiated the Changemaker fellowship. College students from similar communities as our students, are onboarded as Fellows, to manage Peer teaching operations in schools. These fellows gain exposure into the education sector and get a chance to work in a professional environment while still in college

    In the future we aspire for the Peer Teaching program to be entirely sustainable. Towards this goal we will work with school leaders and teachers to set up and monitor the program in their schools, with need based intervention from Involve
